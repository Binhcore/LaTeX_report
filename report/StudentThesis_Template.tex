\begin{abstract}
This thesis deals with building and controlling a finger-like actuator made out of thermoplastic polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride. These soft materials make the robot lighter, more compliant and difficult to control than other robots, which are traditionally stiff and rigid. Since this actuator works with vacuum, it is interesting to know at which negative pressure the actuator exerts which pulling force. It is also interesting to know at which contraction the most traction is exerted. Furthermore, the soft actuator is tested for material fatigue. A comparison shows that this actuator has a higher weight to force ratio than natural muscles. For the control of the artificial muscle, a control architecture is shown in this thesis.
